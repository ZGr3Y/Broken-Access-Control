# 🔐 Broken Access Control: Security Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

Welcome to the repository accompanying the project on **Broken Access Control**. This project explores access control vulnerabilities in web applications, including **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)** and weak **JWT (JSON Web Token) implementations**, and provides detailed mitigation strategies.

## 📘 About the Project

This repository is a companion to a security research project focusing on **Broken Access Control**, a leading cause of web application vulnerabilities as highlighted by the **OWASP Top 10**. The project demonstrates the exploitation of improperly secured systems and presents actionable recommendations to enhance security.

⚠️ **This repository is intended for educational purposes only.** The vulnerable implementation and demonstration tools should not be used in production environments.

---

## ✨ Features

- Demonstrates key vulnerabilities:
  - Weak JWT token validation and signature implementation.
  - Exploitable IDOR vulnerabilities.
- Implements secure practices to mitigate vulnerabilities:
  - Robust token signing and validation.
  - Proper authorization checks.
  - Strong encryption and secure communication protocols.
- Provides an educational platform for developers, students, and security professionals.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. Download it [here](https://nodejs.org).
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/broken-access-control.git
   cd broken-access-control
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. Access the application:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Setting Up the Demonstration Environment
- Ensure **Burp Suite** is installed for testing and intercepting HTTP requests.
- Use the provided vulnerable application to test attacks like:
  - **JWT manipulation** for privilege escalation.
  - **URL parameter tampering** for IDOR exploitation.

---

## 🔍 Exploitation Demonstrations

### 🔑 JWT Token Vulnerabilities
The vulnerable implementation of JWT tokens in this project:
- Uses an empty secret key for token signing.
- Does not validate token signatures, allowing easy forgery.

To exploit:
1. Log in as a standard user and intercept the JWT token.
2. Modify the token payload using tools like Burp Suite or jwt.io.
3. Escalate privileges by altering the `role` claim to `admin`.

### 🔗 IDOR Weaknesses
The IDOR vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user data:
1. Authenticate as a standard user.
2. Modify the `userId` parameter in the URL to access data belonging to other users.

---

## 🛡️ Security Enhancements

The repository includes a **secure implementation** of the system, addressing the demonstrated vulnerabilities:
- Secure JWT signing and verification.
- Ownership validation for user-specific resources.
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data.
- Rate limiting and session expiration for authentication.
